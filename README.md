# Homework 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

I was tasked with retooling this website with semantic tags, and therefore consolidating
the code. While I know I didn't earn a perfect score, it was a great exercise to learn my limits.
I also figured out that I need to get started on the homework early, so that I can take advantage
of the resources at my disposal. I look forward to some tutor sessions and asking more questions!
